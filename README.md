### CSCU9V4

The code within this repository is designed and developed in line with the
practicals for the second year course at the University of Stirling.

## Prerequisites
You need to have the following installed:

- A C compiler
  - The most common one will be gcc - this is one we are using here
- A suitable IDE
  - The files in this repository where created using
  [IntelliJ CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), but any suitable
  editor will work.

## Compiling
As stated earlier, the code was created using my favourite editor, but I have
removed all of the files that the editor generated, leaving just the base
files.

## Folder Layout
The folder structure will be laid out as follows:

    /Practical #/src/main.c

Enjoy!
